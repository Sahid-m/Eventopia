## Eventopia 

# What it is ? 

Eventopia is a Website that lets you view all the ongoing events in university / city and add them directly to your calendar so that you dont forget about it.

It also lets any user publish his events to the DB and lets everyone see and add it.

# How to Setup this locally 

Right Now its front end is only open source and the backend server is not opened as im currently working and i wouldnt want anyone to copy it.
